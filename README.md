Process design aided by machine learning. Define your connected facilities (departments, work cells, service stations, etc.) and the software will guide you in sizing your network (number of servers/employees, waiting time, queues, etc.).

> **IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DOWNLOADING AI-TOOLKIT SOFTWARE:** Please note that products from both companies Google and Microsoft use a wrong system to detect potentially dangerous downloads. These products are for example the internet browsers Chrome, Internet Explorer and operating system Windows 10. **The problem is that they do not test if there is a valid digital signature** in the downloaded file but they flag all downloads which are not downloaded frequently as potentially dangerous. Software (like the AI-TOOLKIT) which is updated frequently can never collect enough downloads to remove this message. You can disable this wrong behavior e.g. in Windows 10 by **switching OFF the Windows Defender SmartScreen** (Internet Options). This is perfectly safe to do if you have an antivirus software!

# FacilityNetworkML
FacilityNetworkML is facility network operation design aided by machine learning. Define your connected facilities (departments, work cells, service stations, etc.; ‘facility’ may mean many things) and the software will guide you in sizing your network (number of servers/employees, waiting time, queues, etc.). The software is very easy and intuitive to use. You just simply need to draw the flow diagram of your connected processes with the mouse, set a few parameters and FacilityNetworkML will do the rest.

FacilityNetworkML uses an evolutionary machine learning model (evolutionary genetic algorithm) for sizing and measuring the facility network.

Evolutionary genetic algorithms (EGAs) got their name from biological evolution theory, which they try to replicate. The terms EGA and biological evolution might seem complex at first but these algorithms are actually simpler than they sound. An EGA is a kind of heuristic (guided or reinforced) search method used for finding the optimum solution based on the theory of natural selection and evolutionary biology, it makes use of the so called Exploitation and Exploration search strategies.
